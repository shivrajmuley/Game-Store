7. Gaming app

If youâ€™re looking for advanced full stack projects, you can always build a gaming app. You will have to ensure some general features in a gaming app such as the use of registration and login process, Multiplayer functionality to allow users to play with others in real-time, In-game chat functionality to enable players to communicate with each other during gameplay, leaderboards, virtual currency, etc. The stack that you will be required to have is:

    Front end: React, Redux, HTML/CSS
    Back end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
    Authentication: JWT
    Virtual currency: Payment gateway integration

You will have to plan out the flow of your game and start building using the back end technologies mentioned above. A gaming app is a fun way to engage users and bring them together to form a community. It will also be a great way to polish your skills as a full stack developer.

Popular gaming apps: Fortnite, Minecraft, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Among Us, etc.
